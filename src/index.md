## Your Friendly-Neighborhood Intellectual Society

![](/images/altaire-sticker.png)

**Altaire** is a Social Networking Service (SNS) for all kinds of intellectuals out there who wish to contribute to the general intelligence of humanity. 

This app allows for the unbounded sharing of information and powerful graph-based visualization of knowledge. We welcome professional thinkers, such as researchers, professors, and teachers. We also welcome underrepresented intellectuals— so called "nerds", "geeks", and "mad scientists" that people around them refer to as. No need for formal backgrounds. Just join, and engage in the very process of advancing the world.
