Welcome to Altaire. This is an open society for underrepresented intellectuals like nerds, geeks, mad scientists, and keyboard warriors who wish to silently contribute to the general intelligence of humanity. Of course, we also welcome researchers, professors, and teachers with formal academic backgrounds. Be part of us, and engage in the very process of saving the future.
